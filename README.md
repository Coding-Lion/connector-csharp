# Flattiverse Reference Connector

This is the Flattiverse reference connector for the binary protocol. You can use this to derive own connectors in other (or even C#) programming languages.

# The current status

This is the implementation of the protocol. It sends 10 packets to the server which echoes those packets.

Additionally the server alters those packets: Session will be the current second.
